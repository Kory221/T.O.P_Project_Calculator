# T.O.P_Project_Calculator
Final project of the Fundations part in The Odin Project cursus.

In this project, we’re going to make an on-screen calculator using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

1 - Create functions for add, subtract, multiply and divide.

2- Create three variables, one for each part of the operation. 
	You’ll use these variables to update your display later.

3- Create a new function called operate that takes an operator and two numbers 
and then calls one of the above functions on the numbers.

4- Create a basic HTML calculator with buttons for each digit and operator (including =).

5- Create the functions that populate the display when you click the digit buttons.

6- Make the calculator work!

Extra credit :

1- Add a . button and let users input decimals! 
2- Add a “backspace” button, so the user can undo their last input if they click the wrong number.
3- Add keyboard support!
